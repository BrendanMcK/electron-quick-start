    <h1>Pretend login form...</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple form that does a window.location.reload() when
      submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works fine with JAWS as initially loaded - JAWS calls
      out the input field names as they receive focus. But on reload,
      JAWS no longer tracks focus properly - and doesn't call out the name or
      type of current focused element. JAWS doesn't even enter forms mode;
      if you press 'H' while focus is on one of the inputs, no 'h' appears,
      instead JAWS moves to the Heading at the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      To restore JAWS functionality, user must focus some other app, seems to
      be necessary to switch to some other app, then switch back to the electron
      app, and click on one of the fields.
    </p>

    <form id="form">
      <div>
        <label>
          Username
          <input id="ip1"/>
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          Password
          <input />
        </label>
      </div>

      <br>
      <button>Login</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      // Optional code to auto-focus input field on reload -
      // Without this, have to hit TAB first. Either way,
      // JAWS fails to sync with focus properly, and fails
      // to switch to forms mode or call out the control type/name.
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
        const input = document.getElementById('ip1');
        input.focus();
      });

      const form = document.findElementById('form');
      form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
          e.preventDefault();
          window.location.reload();
      });
    </script>
  </body>
