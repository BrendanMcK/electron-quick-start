    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>
      Try typing into the &lt;INPUT&gt; field below while VoiceOver is running. VO *should* echo each characeter
      as you type - but it doesn't.
    </p>

    <input autofocus />

    <p>
      Issue also repros with &lt;TEXTAREA&gt;
    </p>

    <textarea> </textarea>

    <p>
      ...and contenteditable DIVs
    </p>

    <div contenteditable="true" style="border: 1px solid black; height: 40px; width: 300px;"></div>

    <p>
      VO does announce the current character as you move the caret around using the arrow keys; but doesn't announce
      as input is typed.
